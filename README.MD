# AI Code Assistant

This application provides a Streamlit-based interface to interact with Azure OpenAI. It can analyze code, generate README content, explain code, and process custom prompts.

---

## Features

1. **Azure OpenAI Integration**  
   - Uses Azure OpenAI API to process code, generate feedback, and produce refined code snippets.
2. **Readme Generation**  
   - Automatically creates a well-structured README comparing and explaining the provided code.
3. **Code Explanation**  
   - Provides detailed explanations for code snippets, identifying potential improvements.
4. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Support**  
   - Uploads content to an Azure Storage Account connected to an AI Search Indexer, enabling retrieval of additional context or new information for more precise output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- A working Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key  
- Properly configured Azure Storage Account with an associated AI Search Indexer  
- Properly configured Azure Search (endpoint, index, indexer)  
- A `.env` file with environment variables:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`
  - `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`
  - `CONTAINER_NAME`
